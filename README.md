## Knapsack problem with 2 constraints

The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization. 
Take set of items, each with value and two constraints 
(e.g. weight and volume), specify the number of items to be included 
in the collection, so that the total value is as large as possible 
and total weight and total volume is less than or equal 
to the given limits.
